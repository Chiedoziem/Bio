  <p class="text-muted">Tunisia,[a] officially the Republic of Tunisia,[b][19] is the northernmost country in Africa. It is a part of the Maghreb region of North Africa, and is bordered by Algeria to the west and southwest, Libya to the southeast, and the Mediterranean Sea to the north and east; covering 163,610 km2 (63,170 sq mi), with a population of 11 million. It contains the eastern end of the Atlas Mountains and the northern reaches of the Sahara desert, with much of its remaining territory arable land. Its 1,300 km (810 mi) of coastline include the African conjunction of the western and eastern parts of the Mediterranean Basin. Tunisia is home to Africa's northernmost point, Cape Angela; and its capital and largest city is Tunis, located on its northeastern coast, which lends the country its name.

    From early antiquity, Tunisia was inhabited by the indigenous Berbers. Phoenicians began to arrive in the 12th century BC, establishing several settlements, of which Carthage emerged as the most powerful by the 7th century BC. A major mercantile empire and a military rival of the Roman Republic, Carthage was defeated by the Romans in 146 BC, who occupied Tunisia for most of the next 800 years, introducing Christianity and leaving architectural legacies like the amphitheatre of El Jem. After several attempts starting in 647, Muslims conquered all of Tunisia by 697, bringing Islam and Arab culture to the local inhabitants. The Ottoman Empire established control in 1574 and held sway for over 300 years, until the French conquered Tunisia in 1881. Tunisia gained independence under the leadership of Habib Bourguiba, who declared the Tunisian Republic in 1957. Today, Tunisia is the smallest nation in North Africa, and its culture and identity are rooted in this centuries-long intersection of different cultures and ethnicities.
    
    In 2011, the Tunisian Revolution, triggered by the lack of freedom and democracy under the 24-year rule of president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, overthrew his regime and catalyzed the broader Arab Spring across the region. Free multiparty parliamentary elections were held shortly after; the country again voted for parliament on 26 October 2014,[20] and for president on 23 November 2014.[21] Tunisia remains a unitary semi-presidential representative democratic republic; and is the only North African country classified as "Free" by Freedom House.[22] From 2014 to 2020, it was considered the only democratic state in the Arab World, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index,[23][c] and was rated a hybrid regime in the 2021 Index.[24] It is one of the few countries in Africa ranking high in the Human Development Index, with one of the highest per capita incomes in the continent.
    
    Tunisia is well integrated into the international community. It is a member of the United Nations, La Francophonie, the Arab League, the OIC, the African Union, the Non-Aligned Movement, the International Criminal Court, and the Group of 77, among others. It maintains close economic and political relations with some European countries, particularly with France,[25] and Italy,[26][27] which geographically lie very close to it. Tunisia also has an association agreement with the European Union, and has also attained the status of a major non-NATO ally of the United States.</p>

        <p class="text-muted">Morocco,[note 3] officially the Kingdom of Morocco,[note 4] is the northwesternmost country in the Maghreb region of North Africa. It overlooks the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and has land borders with Algeria to the east, and the disputed territory of Western Sahara to the south. Morocco also claims the Spanish exclaves of Ceuta, Melilla and Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera, and several small Spanish-controlled islands off its coast.[13] It spans an area of 446,300 km2 (172,300 sq mi)[14] or 710,850 km2 (274,460 sq mi),[b] with a population of roughly 37 million. Its official and predominant religion is Islam, and the official languages are Arabic and Berber; the Moroccan dialect of Arabic and French are also widely spoken. Moroccan identity and culture is a vibrant mix of Berber, Arab, and European cultures. Its capital is Rabat, while its largest city is Casablanca.[15]

          Inhabited since the Paleolithic Era over 90,000 years ago, the first Moroccan state was established by Idris I in 788. It was subsequently ruled by a series of independent dynasties, reaching its zenith as a regional power in the 11th and 12th centuries, under the Almoravid and Almohad dynasties, when it controlled most of the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghreb.[16] In the 15th and 16th centuries, Morocco faced external threats to its sovereignty, with Portugal seizing some territory and the Ottoman Empire encroaching from the east. The Marinid and Saadi dynasties otherwise resisted foreign domination, and Morocco was the only North African nation to escape Ottoman dominion. The Alaouite dynasty, which rules the country to this day, seized power in 1631, and over the next two centuries expanded diplomatic and commercial relations with the Western world. Morocco's strategic location near the mouth of the Mediterranean drew renewed European interest; in 1912, France and Spain divided the country into respective protectorates, reserving an international zone in Tangier. Following intermittent riots and revolts against colonial rule, in 1956 Morocco regained its independence and reunified.
          
          Since independence, Morocco has remained relatively stable. It has the fifth-largest economy in Africa and wields significant influence in both Africa and the Arab world; it is considered a middle power in global affairs and holds membership in the Arab League, the Union for the Mediterranean, and the African Union.[17] Morocco is a unitary semi-constitutional monarchy with an elected parliament. The executive branch is led by the King of Morocco and the prime minister, while legislative power is vested in the two chambers of parliament: the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors. Judicial power rests with the Constitutional Court, which may review the validity of laws, elections, and referenda.[18] The king holds vast executive and legislative powers, especially over the military, foreign policy and religious affairs; he can issue decrees called dahirs, which have the force of law, and can also dissolve the parliament after consulting the prime minister and the president of the constitutional court.
          
          Morocco claims ownership of the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, which it has designated its Southern Provinces. In 1975, after Spain agreed to decolonise the territory and cede its control to Morocco and Mauritania, a guerrilla war broke out between those powers and some of the local inhabitants. In 1979, Mauritania relinquished its claim to the area, but the war continued to rage. In 1991, a ceasefire agreement was reached, but the issue of sovereignty remained unresolved. Today, Morocco occupies two-thirds of the territory, and efforts to resolve the dispute have thus far failed to break the political deadlock.</p>

              <p class="text-muted">Algeria,[c] officially the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa. The country is the largest country by total area in Africa and in the Arab world, and is bordered to the northeast by Tunisia; to the east by Libya; to the southeast by Niger; to the southwest by Mali, Mauritania, and Western Sahara; to the west by Morocco; and to the north by the Mediterranean Sea. It has a semi-arid geography, with most of the population living in the fertile north and the Sahara dominating the geography of the south. Algeria covers an area of 2,381,741 square kilometres (919,595 sq mi), making it the world's tenth largest nation by area, and the largest nation in Africa.[9] With a population of 44 million, Algeria is the ninth-most populous country in Africa, and the 32nd-most populous country in the world. The capital and largest city is Algiers, located in the far north on the Mediterranean coast.

                Pre-1962 Algeria has seen many empires and dynasties, including ancient Numidians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Byzantines, Umayyads, Abbasids, Rustamids, Idrisids, Aghlabids, Fatimids, Zirids, Hammadids, Almoravids, Almohads, Zayyanids, Spaniards, Ottomans and finally, the French colonial empire. The vast majority of Algeria's population is Arab-Berber, practicing Islam, and using the official languages of Arabic and Berber. However, French serves as an administrative and educational language in some contexts. The main spoken language is Algerian Arabic.
                
                Algeria is a semi-presidential republic, with local constituencies consisting of 58 provinces and 1,541 communes. Algeria is a regional power in North Africa, and a middle power in global affairs. It has the highest Human Development Index of all non-island African countries and one of the largest economies on the continent, based largely on energy exports. Algeria has the world's sixteenth-largest oil reserves and the ninth-largest reserves of natural gas. Sonatrach, the national oil company, is the largest company in Africa, supplying large amounts of natural gas to Europe. Algeria's military is one of the largest in Africa, and has the largest defence budget on the continent. It is a member of the African Union, the Arab League, the OIC, OPEC, the United Nations, and the Arab Maghreb Union, of which it is a founding member.

      <p>If you ask me, this movie has quickly become my favorite animated movie of the 2020 decade (So far)! Soul is in close second, but I think Turning Red is even better than that movie! Now despite the outcry of criticism this film has been getting on Twitter, I highly recommend watching it because it's DEFINITELY nowhere near as bad as those Twitter people are saying it is! 

        Anyway, Turning Red is easily yet another great addition to the Pixar library of amazing classic animated films! The story is incredibly well told with some great comedy and amazing heartwarming moments, the animation is still Pixar's usual quality of greatness with Canada being greatly detailed in this movie! And finally EVERY single character is memorable in their own rights with relatable problems that they might face! And finally, I love the overall theme and message of this movie tries to share which includes you shouldn't hold that wild side your parents would disapprove of and learn to fully express yourself! 
        
        With that said, Turning Red is an ABSOLUTE must watch movie for this year as I literally only have one minor problem with this movie, but I could easily ignore it. If your a Pixar fan, animation fan, or even an movie fan this is definitely a film worth checking out!

      <p>This spectacle is of the utmost decency and immense amusement, or as K genuinely exclaim. Heck, this is an ironic coincidink, but, my ethnicity, province, and descent is a conformed hybrid of Lantino, (particularly mi padre side of my kin), and manifestly white from mi madre’s side of my kin so hopefully you won’t intend to be flagrant, insolent, sassy, irreverent, obscene, and somewhat diss me.

        So anyway, there is quite so many countless principles and even implications in Encanto that could be precise, and not even erroneous for the prime machination of the film itself, so as a question, inquire, query and even a mere riddle, “WAS BRUNO DRASTICALLY INFLUENCING THE KINDRED MADRIGAL? OR WAS IT THE GRANDMOTHER, OR THE PRIME PROTAGONIST THE STORY ARC ITSELF, EITHER WAY, ALBEIT A SOMEWHAT OBSCURE, MIRACULOUS AND PRETTY AMBIGUOUS DEBACLE AND/OR NUISANCE, IT’S A UBER ABSOLUTE PARADIGM SHIFT THAT APPARENTLY ALLUDES, AGITATES ME ENTIRELY AND EVEN DISCOMBOBULATES ME EXCEEDINGLY, I’M GETTING SUCH AN EMOTIONAL MIGRAINE IN THE HYBRID OF THE FILM, ITSELF.
        
        But the principle and conviction of the magical provincial sentient house conundrum currently remains to be somewhat apparently unfathomable to me, well intuitively at the merest. So anywho, the harmonious and catchy songs and encore musical numbers are truly compelling and theoretically somewhat invocative to the rational overshadowing point of Encanto itself, the most quintessential Encanto song in the whole demographic nation is “We Don’t Talk About Bruno”, my collateral favorite song is “All of You” with a reconcilable and coalescent moment of gist, and also the WDTAB, (MY OWN ACRONYM, PARTICULARLY PERTAINING TO THE WE DON’T TALK ABOUT BRUNO SONG), this solemn implication, (that which I find to be somewhat speculative and plausible), Bruno himself, which they the whole kindred Madrigal desperately wants to keep coy, confidential, classified and likely arcane could actually be referent to Luca.
        
        So for Luca, I’m genuinely curious and wondering if there is an actual correlated moment of BRUNO MADRIGAL and ALBERTO, consistently on the whole “SILENCO BRUNO!” statement and is alberto is the masculine protege, and Bruno his kindred father figure. And also, (collaterally), I’d love to optically witness a whole DISNEY LUCA & ENCANTO MAJOR CROSSOVER CIRCUMSTANCES, either way I’m pretty stoked about the whole vivid notion, myself.
        
        So overall, in downright summation, it’s a pretty vivacious story arc and decent storytelling is out of major sufficiency and I interpret the spectacle of being immensely breathtaking as well as clever, mischievous and sentimental as well too.</p>
